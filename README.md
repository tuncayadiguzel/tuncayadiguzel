I am currently working mainly on heat & flow based, electrically automated systems projects by blending the design engineering notion I acquired from the strong theoretical education and management skills as a former retrofit project manager at shipyard. Recently developed myself on automation systems in order to fill the communication gap between electrical and mechanical engineers. I am open to an R&D / Technical director positions at a global company.
